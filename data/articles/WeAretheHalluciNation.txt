a tribe called red creates music that acts as a gateway into urban, contemporary indigenous culture, celebrating all of its layers and complexity. in a set that blends traditional powwow drums and vocals with hip-hop and electronic music, the dj collective tells stories of the first nations in beats and images -- expanding on the concept of the "halluci nation," inspired by the poet, musician and activist john trudell.
