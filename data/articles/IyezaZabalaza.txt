Thank you so much for having us here. My name is Thandiswa Mazwai. I am a wild woman, a rebel singer, a conduit. My music is about memory and struggling between oppresion and freedom. After over 20 years in South Africa we find ourselves as the black masses still suffering and fighting for our freedom and humanity. This first song was called "Iyeza" which means "medicine." Medicine for our madness, medicine for our rage. This song we're doing now is called "Zabalaza," and it means "rebel." I'd like to dedicate this to the valiant student movement in South Africa who came up with the #FeesMustFall.(Applause)Rhodes Must Fall.(Applause)But more importantly, the new vigor that has been brought into the feminist movement so patriarchy must fall.(Applause)(Music)Gogo bek' umthwaloKunin' uhlupheka?Little ghetto childUngazibulali sanaOh ...If you take my hand,I'll show youhow to be free.Ayifanelang' ub' iyenzeka lentoEmzini kabawokunge kudalaSizozabalaza.Zabalaza, zabalaza.Zabalaza.Sizozabalaza.Zabalaza, zabalaza.Zabalaza.Zabalaza, zabalaza.Zabalaza.Zabalaza.Zabalaza.Zabalaza.(Vocalizing)(Improvising)It's my people in Soweto,my people in Mozambique,my people in Senegal.These are my people in the ghettos.Zabalaza, zabalaza.Zabalaza.Zabalaza.(Music ends)(Applause)(Cheering)Thank you very much.(Applause)
