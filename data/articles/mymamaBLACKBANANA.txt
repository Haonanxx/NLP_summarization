(Guitar music starts)I've been lookingSeveral days nowWhere did they go?Where did they go?My mama told me long agoI've lost so many precious things, I knowThey won't be backWhere did they go?My mama told me long agoAin't nobody's ever gonna tell me to abandon my old friendHappy days, walking on the shoreHappy days, walking on the shoreHappy days, walking on the shoreAin't nobody's ever gonna tell me to abandon my good memories at allI've seen so many pretty thingsThey don't mean a thing nowListen to the songMy mama told me long agoAin't nobody's ever gonna tell me to doubt my good old daysHappy days, walking on the shoreHappy days, walking on the shoreHappy days, walking on the shoreAin't nobody's ever gonna tell me to abandon my good memories at allAbandon my good memories at allAbandon my good memories at all(Music ends)(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you for giving me the opportunity to perform tonight at TED New York. I've been a dedicated TED fan and viewer, and also, I actually used to live in Manhattan when I was younger, so New York is like a second home to me, and it's great to be back. The song I just performed was called "my mama," and the next song I'm going to perform is another original song of mine called "BLACK BANANA." This song I wrote about the importance of being patient with your dreams. Because I think commitment will always be rewarded. Just like fruit ripens when the time is right. So it's my interpretation of building the future.(Guitar music starts)Clap your hands.One! Two!
