(Music)Sun shining up above down here it's 10 belowI'm moving on to a place now where the streets are paved with goldThere'll be two trains running — running side by sideSome trains are going outTwo trains running — running side by sideI'm going to catch that fast express train to my reward in the skyMany rooms in my father's house now — Oh Lord there's one for you and meMany rooms in my father's house now — Oh there's one for you and meNo blues and no trouble Oh my Lord sweet Jesus victoryThere's one glory from the moon — Lord another, oh another from the sunOh one glory from the moon and another from the sunBehind I'll leave this earthly body when my Lord king Jesus comesThank you very much.(Applause)
