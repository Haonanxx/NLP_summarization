 - Don Quixote, Introduction to Part II
González Echevarría talks about the transition that we, as present-day readers undergo, between Part I, published in 1605, and Part II of the , published in 1615. He first reviews the grand themes of part one: 1) ambiguity and perspectivism, 2) the idea that the self can impose its will but only to a certain point and the ontological doubt, 3) reading, 4) characters that are relational and not static, and 5) improvisation. He then moves on to Part II of the book: Cervantes’ moment as a writer, the cultural context, the titles of both parts and the spurious Avellaneda’s  are commented upon. The second half of the lecture talks about the writing of the second part of the novel and its main characteristics in relation to Part I.
