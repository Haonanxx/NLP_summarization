 - William Butler Yeats (cont.)
Yeats’s middle period is explored, beginning with the middle-aged Yeats’s assumption of the role of spokesman for Irish nationalism and the development of his complicated response to nationalist violence. The aestheticization of violence is considered in the poem “Easter, 1916” and briefly in “The Statues.” Yeats’s conception of the relationship of violence to history, with particular emphasis on the frightening interaction among the divine, the human, and the bestial, is demonstrated in the visionary poems “The Second Coming” and “The Magi,” and finally in “Leda and the Swan.”W.B.
