 - Wallace Stevens (cont.)
The late poetry of Wallace Stevens is presented and analyzed. Stevens’s conception of the poet as reader and the world as a text to be read and translated is considered in “Large Red Man Reading” and “The Poem that Took the Place of a Mountain.” The poet’s preoccupation with natural cycles and sensory experience is exhibited in “The Plain Sense of Things.” Finally, “A Primitive Like an Orb” is interpreted as Stevens’s final vision of ceaseless change and transition in the world, in which the poet’s verbal play participates.Wallace Stevens, “The Poem that Took the Place of a Mountain,” 1954; “The Plain Sense of Things,” 1954 and “Not Ideas about the Thing but the Thing Itself,” 1954.
