 - Robert Frost (cont.)
In this second lecture on the poetry of Robert Frost, the poet’s use of iambic pentameter in “Birches” is discussed.  Frost’s anti-modernity is evidenced in his interest in rural New England culture and his concern with the lives of laborers in “Home Burial.”  The failure of humanity to work real change is sardonically depicted in “Provide, Provide,” but a hopeful vision of the power of imagination is presented in the final lines of the late poem, “Directive.”“Provide, Provide” and “Out, Out–” from THE POETRY OF ROBERT FROST edited by Edward Connery Lathem.
