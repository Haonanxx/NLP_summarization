 - Ezra Pound
The lecture introduces the poetry of Ezra Pound. Tensions in Pound’s personality and career are considered, particularly in terms of his relationships with other poets and his fascism and anti-capitalism. The poem “The Seafarer” is examined as a quintessentially Poundian project in its treatment and translation of poetic forms. The first of his epic project, The Cantos, is analyzed as a meditation on the process of expressing and engaging with history and literary tradition.
