 - William Butler Yeats (cont.)
Yeats’s late poetry is discussed and interpreted. The poet’s interest in human knowledge and its relationship to the body, particularly the aging body, is traced from “Leda and the Swan” to “Sailing to Byzantium,” “In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markievicz,” “Two Songs from a Play,” and “Vacillation.” Yeats’s late interest in the experiences of joy, madness, and “gaiety” is examined in “Crazy Jane Talks with the Bishop.” Yeats’s de-mystifying attitude toward art in “The Circus Animals’ Destruction” is contrasted with his celebration of art in “Lapis Lazuli.”W.B.
