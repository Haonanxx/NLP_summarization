 - Hart Crane (cont.)
Hart Crane’s masterwork  is positioned as a response to the modernist aesthetics of T.S. Eliot’s . The visionary and specifically American aspects of the epic are stressed. Crane’s interest in myth and symbol, his inclusion and treatment of marginal figures, and his refiguring of the American hero are considered alongside his unique perspective on the role of imagination in the creation and shaping of history.
