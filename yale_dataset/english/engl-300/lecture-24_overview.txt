 - The Institutional Construction of Literary Study
In this lecture on critical identities, Professor Fry examines the work of Stanley Fish and John Guillory. The lecture begins by examining  as a site for the emergence of literary identities, then brings the course’s use of the children’s story under scrutiny through the lens of Fish. The evolution of Fish’s theory of interpretive communities is traced chronologically through his publications and examined in close-up in Milton’s . John Guillory’s work on interpretive communities and the culture wars leads to a discussion of the Western canon and multiculturalism.
