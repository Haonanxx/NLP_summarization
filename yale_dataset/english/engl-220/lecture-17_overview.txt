 - Paradise Lost, Book IX
Book Nine and the depiction of the Fall are presented. Adam and Eve’s dialogue – especially their perspectives on labor, temptation, and the nature of the garden – is examined. Satan’s strategic temptation of Eve is closely analyzed. At the lecture’s conclusion, Adam and Eve’s new fallen sight is discussed, with particular emphasis placed on the reference to the “veil” of pre-fallen innocence. Overall, the tension between doctrinal and subversive perspectives on the pre-fallen hierarchy of Eden is underscored.
