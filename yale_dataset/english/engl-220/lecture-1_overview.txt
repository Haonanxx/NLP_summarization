 - Introduction: Milton, Power, and the Power of Milton
An introduction to John Milton: man, poet, and legend. Milton’s place at the center of the English literary canon is asserted, articulated, and examined through a discussion of Milton’s long, complicated association with literary power. The conception of Miltonic power and its calculated use in political literature is analyzed in the feminist writings of Lady Mary Chudleigh, Mary Astell, and Virginia Woolf. Later the god-like qualities often ascribed to Miltonic authority are considered alongside Satan’s excursus on the constructed nature of divine might in , and the notorious character’s method of analysis is shown to be a useful mode of encountering the author himself.
