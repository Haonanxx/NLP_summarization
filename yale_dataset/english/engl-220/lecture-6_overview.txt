 - Lycidas
Milton’s poem  is discussed as an example of pastoral elegy and one of Milton’s first forays into theodicy. The poetic speaker’s preoccupation with questions of immortality and reward, especially for poets and virgins, is probed. The Christian elements of the poem’s dilemma are addressed, while the solution to the speaker’s crisis is characterized as erotic and oddly paganistic, pointing towards the heterodox nature of much of Milton’s thinking.
