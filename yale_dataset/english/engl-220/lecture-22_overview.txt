 - Paradise Regained, Books III-IV
In this second lecture on , the three temptations are examined and Milton’s unusual departure from their account in the Gospel of Luke is discussed. The poem’s tacit assertion of the superiority of knowledge and ethics over action is probed. Considerable time is spent examining the Son’s rejection of classical literature. Finally, Book Four’s allusion to the riddle of the sphinx serves as a springboard to a consideration of the poem’s Oedipal elements.
