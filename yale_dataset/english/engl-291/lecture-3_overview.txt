 - Flannery O'Connor, Wise Blood
Professor Amy Hungerford’s first lecture on Flannery O’Connor’s  addresses questions of faith and interpretation. She uses excerpts from O’Connor’s copious correspondence to introduce the critical framework of O’Connor’s Catholicism, but invites us to look beyond the question of redemption. What do characters see in this text, and what are they blind to? What do we see as readers, and how does methodology shape this vision?
