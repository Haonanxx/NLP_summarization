 - Communicating Molecular Structure in Diagrams and Words
It is important that chemists agree on notation and nomenclature in order to communicate molecular constitution and configuration. It is best when a diagram is as faithful as possible to the 3-dimensional shape of a molecule, but the conventional Fischer projection, which has been indispensable in understanding sugar configurations for over a century, involves highly distorted bonds. Ambiguity in diagrams or words has led to multibillion-dollar patent disputes involving popular drugs. International agreements provide descriptive, unambiguous, unique, systematic “IUPAC” names that are reasonably convenient for most organic molecules of modest molecular weight.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)
