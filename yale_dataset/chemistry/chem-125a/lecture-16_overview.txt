 - Recognizing Functional Groups
This lecture continues the discussion of the HOMO/LUMO view of chemical reactivity by focusing on ways of recognizing whether a particular HOMO should be unusually high in energy (basic), or a particular LUMO should be unusually low (acidic). The approach is illustrated with BH, which is both acidic and basic and thus dimerizes by forming unusual “Y” bonds. The low LUMOs that make both HF and CHF acidic are analyzed and compared underlining the distinction between MO nodes that derive from atomic orbitals nodes (AON) and those that are antibonding (ABN). Reaction of HF as an acid with OH is shown to involve simultaneous bond-making and bond-breaking.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)
