 - Checking Hybridization Theory with XH3
This lecture brings experiment to bear on the previous theoretical discussion of bonding by focusing on hybridization of the central atom in three XH molecules. Because independent electron pairs must not overlap, hybridization can be related to molecular structure by a simple equation. The “Umbrella Vibration” and the associated rehybridization of the central atom is used to illustrate how a competition between strong bonds and stable atoms works to create differences in molecular structure that discriminate between bonding models. Infrared and electron spin resonance experiments confirm our understanding of the determinants of molecular structure.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)
