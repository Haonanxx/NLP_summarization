 - Sharpless Oxidation Catalysts and the Conformation of Cycloalkanes
Professor Barry Sharpless of Scripps describes the Nobel-prizewinning development of titanium-based catalysts for stereoselective oxidation, the mechanism of their reactions, and their use in preparing esomeprazole. Conformational energy of cyclic alkanes illustrates the use of molecular mechanics.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)
