 - Valence Theory and Constitutional Structure (1858)
Youthful chemists Couper and Kekulé replaced radical and type theories with a new approach involving atomic valence and molecular structure, and based on the tetravalence and self-linking of carbon. Valence structures offered the first explanation for isomerism, and led to the invention of nomenclature, notation, and molecular models closely related to those in use today.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)
