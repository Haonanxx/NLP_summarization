 - Force Laws, Lewis Structures and Resonance
Professor McBride begins by following Newton’s admonition to search for the force law that describes chemical bonding. Neither direct (Hooke’s Law) nor inverse (Coulomb, Gravity) dependence on distance will do - a composite like the Morse potential is needed. G. N. Lewis devised a “cubic-octet” theory based on the newly discovered electron, and developed it into a shared pair model to explain bonding. After discussing Lewis-dot notation and formal charge, Professor McBride shows that in some “single-minimum” cases the Lewis formalism is inadequate and salvaging it required introducing the confusing concept of “resonance.”Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)
