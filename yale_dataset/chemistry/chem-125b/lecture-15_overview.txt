 - Metals and Catalysis in Alkene Oxidation, Hydrogenation, Metathesis, and Polymerization
Alkenes may be oxidized to diols by permanganate or by OsO catalysis.Metal catalysts provide orbitals that allow simultaneous formation of two bonds from metal to alkene or H. Coupling such oxidative additions to reductive eliminations, provides a low-energy catalytic path for addition of H to an alkene. Such catalytic hydrogenation is often said to involve  stereochemistry, but the primary literature shows that addition can be  when allylic rearrangement occurs on the catalyst. Similar oxidative/reductive cycles operate in olefin metathesis and metal-catalyzed polymerization. Careful catalyst design allows control over polymer stereochemistry (tacticity). Polymerizations catalyzed by free-radicals or acids typically lack stereochemical control, but there are ways to control regiochemistry and chain length.
