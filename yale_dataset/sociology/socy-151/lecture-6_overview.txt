 - Rousseau on State of Nature and Education
The general will – dangerous if taken too far – operates in many elements of our social and civic life. Immunizations that are compulsory for living in dorms serve the common good – the general will – regardless of individual will. The general will operates in society when individuals develop not only , selfish love, but also , love of self in relation to others. Rousseau distinguished between bourgeois individuals who have  and citizens who exemplify . In addition to being a political and social thinker, Rousseau is an early and influential education theorist. In his book , Rousseau argues that individuals are born good but are corrupted by society. He advocates “negative education” which aims at reducing mental errors that students may pick up in society. Negative education, Rousseau argues, is accomplished by focusing on educating students on how to think rather than training them in what to think.
