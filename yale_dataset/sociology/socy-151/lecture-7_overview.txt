 - Mill: Utilitarianism and Liberty
Adam Smith’s ideas about self-interest should be understood as a precursor in some ways to John Stuart Mill’s thinking on utilitarianism. Professor Szelényi discusses, but does not resolve, the complexities of Adam Smith’s moral and ethical positions staked out in including a focus on sympathy – and the most widespread economic interpretation of Smith and  that he is the economist of self-interest. One way to reconcile these so-called “two Smiths” is that, as social beings, it is in our self-interest to express benevolence and sympathy toward others. Mill, the student of Bentham since a very young age, humanizes the theory of utilitarianism. Perhaps he should be best remembered for his staunch views on liberty: liberty must never be compromised for the sake of expediency.
