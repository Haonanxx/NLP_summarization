 - Apocalyptic and Resistance
The Apocalypse, or the Revelation of John, shares many of the traits found in apocalyptic literature: it operates in dualisms–earthly events contrasted with heavenly ones, present time with the imminent future, and it calls for cultural and political resistance. Its structure is like a spiral, presenting cycle after cycle of building tension and reprieve, so that the reader who experiences the text also experiences crisis and then catharsis. Politically, Revelation equates Rome with Babylon and the empire as the domain of Satan.
