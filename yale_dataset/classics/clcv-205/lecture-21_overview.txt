 - The Struggle for Hegemony in Fourth-Century Greece
In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War and how the Spartans began to dominate other Greek , instead of liberating them. The Spartan general Lysander at this point not only grows in influence and power, but also follows an aggressive plan to establish pro-Spartan, oligarchical governments. However, according to Professor Kagan, this fact angered many cities. Therefore, Thrasybulus, along with the help of other , resisted Spartan rule. Eventually he opposed Sparta at Phyle and in time reestablished the democracy of Athens.
