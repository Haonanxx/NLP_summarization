 - The Struggle for Hegemony in Fourth-Century Greece (cont.)
In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines the continuation of Spartan tyranny over the Greek and the response of the Greek world. According to Professor Kagan, it became clear that the Greek needed to do something to check the power of Sparta. So, Thebes, Argos, Corinth, and Athens along with some of the smaller  joined together to fight Sparta in the Corinthian War. The war ended in a stalemate, but now the Persians were afraid of the growth of Athenian naval power. So, the king made an alliance with Sparta to bring about the King’s Peace, which emphasized Greek autonomy and which had the effect of breaking up all alliances, except the Peloponnesian League. After this fact, Sparta continued in its tyrannical behavior.
