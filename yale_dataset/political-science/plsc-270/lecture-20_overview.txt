 - Policy Targets for Capitalist Development
Professor Rae begins by briefly discussing his recent trip to Washington, where he became more closely acquainted with the health care reform bill. Professor Rae uses this example to highlight the intimate connections between capitalist market systems and the government. Then, with the help of two guest speakers, Professor Rae discusses the dramatic downfall and planned revival of one of Yale’s most iconic institutions: Mory’s club. Various methods for increasing the club’s relevance to the contemporary Yale community are discussed, including reforming membership rules.
