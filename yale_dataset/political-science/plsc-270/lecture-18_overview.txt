 - Microfinance in South India
Professor Rae teaches the SELCO business case, about a distributed electric power generation scheme targeting rural Indians. In presenting the case, Professor Rae discusses several analytical frameworks for thinking through business cases, including SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), and the Porter Forces. Issues with SELCO’s business model are discussed, including the scalability of their operations, and capacity to break into higher margin markets. SELCO’s financing structure and partnership with a local microfinance institution are also explored. Students offer suggestions about how to improve SELCO’s business.
