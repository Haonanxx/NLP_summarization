Guest speaker Paolo Zanonni, partner at Goldman Sachs, explains a major deal in the European utilities market. Enel, a major European utility, attempted to totally transform its position by expanding into the Spanish market and acquiring the Spanish utility Endesa. The deal was exceedingly complex, and involved multiple European governments, intense regional politics, and a handful of enormous utility companies. The transaction shows the important links between politics and free-market operations.
