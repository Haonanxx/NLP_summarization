 - Guest Lecture by Richard Medley: Entrepreneurship in Business Information
Richard Medley, former CEO of the business intelligence firm Medley Global Advisors (MGA), discusses MGA and the problem of selling the company that had been built entirely around him. MGA dealt in information arbitrage, selling high-demand political/economic information for large amounts of money. The legal, ethical, and theoretical implications of information arbitrage are discussed. MGA’s work is bounced against theories of free markets, which require equal access to information. Mr. Medley discusses his work at George Soros’ firm and the attack on the pound sterling.
