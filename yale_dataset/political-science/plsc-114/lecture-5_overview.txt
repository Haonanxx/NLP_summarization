 - Philosophers and Kings: Plato, Republic, III-IV
The discussion of the Republic continues. An account is given of the various figures, their role in the dialogue and what they represent in the work overall. Socrates challenges Polemarchus’ argument on justice, questions the distinction between a friend and an enemy, and asserts his famous thesis that all virtues require knowledge and reflection at their basis.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
