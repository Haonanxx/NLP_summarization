 - Democratic Statecraft: Tocqueville, Democracy in America
Three main features that Tocqueville regarded as central to American democracy are discussed: the importance of local government, the concept of “civil association,” and “the spirit of religion.” The book is not simply a celebration of the democratic experience in America; Tocqueville is deeply worried about the potential of a democratic tyranny.Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, trans.
