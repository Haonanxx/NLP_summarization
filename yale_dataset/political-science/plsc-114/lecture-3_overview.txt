 - Socratic Citizenship: Plato, Crito
In the Apology, Socrates proposes a new kind of citizenship in opposition to the traditional one that was based on the poetic conception of Homer. Socrates’ is a philosophical citizenship, relying on one’s own powers of independent reason and judgment. The Crito, a dialogue taking place in Socrates’ prison cell, is about civil obedience, piety, and the duty of every citizen to respect and live by the laws of the community.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts CollectionPlato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
