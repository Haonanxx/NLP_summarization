 - The Mixed Regime and the Rule of Law: Aristotle, Politics, I, III
The lecture begins with an introduction of Aristotle’s life and works which constitute thematic treatises on virtually every topic, from biology to ethics to politics. Emphasis is placed on the Politics, in which Aristotle expounds his view on the naturalness of the city and his claim that man is a political animal by nature.Aristotle, , translated by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
