 - Socratic Citizenship: Plato, Apology
The lecture begins with an explanation of why Plato’s Apology is the best introductory text to the study of political philosophy. The focus remains on the Apology as a symbol for the violation of free expression, with Socrates justifying his way of life as a philosopher and defending the utility of philosophy for political life.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts CollectionPlato, Crito, translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
