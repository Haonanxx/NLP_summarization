 - Constitutional Government: Locke, Second Treatise (13-19)
In this lecture, two important issues are addressed in the context of Locke’s Second Treatise. First, there is discussion on the role of the executive vis-a-vis the legislative branch of government in Locke’s theory of the constitutional state. Second, Locke’s political theories are related to the American regime and contemporary American political philosophy. The lecture concludes with John Rawls’ book, A Theory of Justice, and how his general theory relates to Locke’s political ideas.John Locke, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
