 - Introduction: What Is Political Philosophy?
Professor Smith discusses the nature and scope of “political philosophy.” The oldest of the social sciences, the study of political philosophy must begin with the works of Plato and Aristotle, and examine in depth the fundamental concepts and categories of the study of politics. The questions “which regimes are best?” and “what constitutes good citizenship?” are posed and discussed in the context of Plato’s Apology.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
