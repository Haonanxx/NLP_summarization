 - The Sovereign State: Hobbes, Leviathan
The concept of sovereignty is discussed in Hobbesian terms. For Hobbes, “the sovereign” is an office rather than a person, and can be characterized by what we have come to associate with executive power and executive authority. Hobbes’ theories of laws are also addressed and the distinction he makes between “just laws” and “good laws.” The lecture ends with a discussion of Hobbes’ ideas in the context of the modern state.Thomas Hobbes, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
