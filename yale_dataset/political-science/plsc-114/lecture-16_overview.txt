 - Constitutional Government: Locke, Second Treatise (7-12)
In the opening chapters of his Second Treatise, Locke “rewrites” the account of human beginnings that had belonged exclusively to Scripture. He tells the story of how humans, finding themselves in a condition of nature with no adjudicating authority, enjoy property acquired through their labor. The lecture goes on to discuss the idea of natural law, the issue of government by consent, and what may be considered Locke’s most significant contribution to political philosophy: the Doctrine of Consent.John Locke, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
