 - The Mixed Regime and the Rule of Law: Aristotle, Politics, VII
This final lecture on Aristotle focuses on controlling conflict between factions. Polity as a mixture of the principles of oligarchy and democracy, is the regime that, according to Aristotle, can most successfully control factions and avoid dominance by either extreme. Professor Smith asserts that the idea of the polity anticipates Madison’s call for a government in which powers are separated and kept in check and balance, avoiding therefore the extremes of both tyranny and civil war.Aristotle, , translated by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection
