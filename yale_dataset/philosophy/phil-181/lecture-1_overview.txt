 - Introduction
Professor Gendler explains the interdisciplinary nature of the course: work from philosophy, psychology, behavioral economics, and literature will be brought to bear on the topic of human nature. The three main topics of the course are introduced–happiness and flourishing, morality, and political philosophy–and examples of some of the course’s future topics are discussed.
