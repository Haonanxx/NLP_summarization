 - Plato, Part II: Arguments for the Immortality of the Soul
The discussion of Plato’s  continues, presenting more arguments for the existence and immortality of the soul. One such argument is “the argument from the nature of the forms,” which states that because the forms are non-physical objects and cannot be grasped by something physical like the body, it follows that they must be grasped by the soul which must be non-physical as well. This argument is followed by the “argument from recycling” and “the argument from recollection.”
