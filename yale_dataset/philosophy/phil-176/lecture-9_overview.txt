 - Plato, Part IV: Arguments for the Immortality of the Soul (cont.)
Professor Kagan elaborates on the “argument from simplicity” and discusses in detail Plato’s claims that the soul is simple, changeless and therefore indestructible. The final Platonic argument under discussion is the “argument from essential properties” in which the essential properties of the soul are addressed. At the end of the lecture the question of whether one needs to argue for physicalism is posed.
