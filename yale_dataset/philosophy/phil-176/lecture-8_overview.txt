 - Plato, Part III: Arguments for the Immortality of the Soul (cont.)
The lecture focuses exclusively on one argument for the immortality of the soul from Plato’s , namely, “the argument from simplicity.” Plato suggests that in order for something to be destroyed, it must have parts, that is, it must be possible to “take it apart.” Arguing that the soul is simple, that it does not have parts, Plato believes that it would logically follow that the soul is indestructible.
