 - Introduction to Plato's Phaedo; Arguments for the Existence of the Soul, Part II
After a brief introduction to Plato’s , more arguments are offered in this lecture in defense of the existence of an immaterial soul. The emphasis here is on the fact that we need to believe in the existence of a soul in order to explain the claim that we possess free will. This is an argument dualists use as an objection to the physicalists: since no merely physical entity could have free will, there must be more to us than just being a physical object.
