 - The Waning of Religious Authority
Religion in France after the Revolution can be understood in terms of two forms of de-Christianization. The first of these is political, and takes place in the  separation of church and state. The second is a decline in religious practice among individual citizens. While the history of the former change is well documented, the latter is a more ambiguous phenomenon. Despite the statistical decline in religious participation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Catholicism in particular continues to play a significant role in the cultural imagination, or , of many French people.
