 - Peter the Great
Peter the Great’s historical significance stems not only from his military ambitions and the great expansion of the Russian Empire under his supervision, but also from his efforts to introduce secular, Western customs and ideas into Russian culture. Despite his notorious personal brutality, Peter’s enthusiasm for science and modern intellectual concerns made an indelible mark both on Russia’s relationship to the West and on its internal politics. The struggle under Peter’s reign between Westernizers and Slavophiles, or those who resist foreign influences, can be seen at work in Russia up to the present day.
