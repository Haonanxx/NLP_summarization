 - Expansion and Slavery: Legacies of the Mexican War and the Compromise of 1850
In this lecture, Professor Blight discusses some of the conflicts, controversies, and compromises that led up to the Civil War. After analyzing Frederick Douglass’s 1852 Fourth of July speech and the inherent conflict between American slavery and American freedom, the lecture moves into a lengthy discussion of the war with Mexico in the 1840s. Professor Blight explains why northerners and southerners made “such a fuss” over the issue of slavery’s expansion into the western territories. The lecture ends with the crisis over California’s admission to statehood and the Compromise of 1850.
