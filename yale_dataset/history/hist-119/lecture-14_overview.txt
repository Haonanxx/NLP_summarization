 - Never Call Retreat: Military and Political Turning Points in 1863
Professor Blight lectures on the military history of the early part of the war. Beginning with events in the West, Blight describes the Union victories at Fort Donelson and Fort Henry, introduces Union General Ulysses S. Grant, and narrates the horrific battle of Shiloh, fought in April of 1862. Moving back East, the lecture describes the Union General George McClellan’s abortive 1862 Peninsula campaign, which introduced the world to Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. The lecture concludes with Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s decision to take the battle to the North.
