 - Risk and Law: Pesticide Paradigm
The lecture charts the evolution of pesticide regulation in the United States. The evolution of the management and regulation of pesticides reflects changes in scientific understanding of pesticides as well as changes in human values. As technology allowed for testing of pesticides at smaller and smaller concentrations, restrictions on pesticide use grew. The government’s growing understanding of cumulative risk also has led to changes in pesticide testing and regulation.
