 - Dawn of Freedom
Professor Holloway offers an introduction to the course. He explains the organization of the course and summarizes some of the key concepts that will be explored over the course of the semester. Professor Holloway uses the African American experience as a prism to understand American history, because, as he notes, the African American experience speaks to the very heart of what it means to be American. He highlights specific examples of the linkage between freedom, citizenship, and the denial of citizenship, including an ex-slave’s epitaph and Confederate scrip. Finally, Professor Holloway shows how the post-emancipation African American experience is a history of political struggle, social protest, social control, cultural celebration, and a history of powerful relevance today for many of its political and cultural symbols.
