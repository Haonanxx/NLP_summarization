 - Dawn of Freedom (continued)
In this lecture, Professor Holloway gives a brief summary of what was happening in the decades leading up to the Civil War, including the Missouri Compromise, the Dred Scott decision, and John Brown’s raid at Harpers Ferry. He discusses the Civil War, focusing specifically on the Emancipation Proclamation and the Conscription Acts of 1863. Professor Holloway spends the duration of the lecture focusing on the labor and racial tensions that led to the New York City draft riots and their aftermath. The crucible of the Civil War, he argues, gives a very clear picture of what it means to be a citizen and what it means to be American. Professor Holloway then gives specific examples of how citizenship was linked to freedom, how freedom was linked to race, and how the tensions between these linkages produced extreme violence.
