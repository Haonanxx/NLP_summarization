 - Course Introduction and Newtonian Mechanics
Professor Shankar introduces the course and answers student questions about the material and the requirements. He gives an overview of Newtonian mechanics and explains its two components: kinematics and dynamics. He then reviews basic concepts in calculus through two key equations: x = x + vt + ½ at and v = v+ 2 a (x-x), tracing the fate of a particle in one dimension along the x-axis.
