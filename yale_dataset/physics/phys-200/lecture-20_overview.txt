 - Fluid Dynamics and Statics and Bernoulli's Equation
The focus of the lecture is on fluid dynamics and statics. Different properties are discussed, such as density and pressure. The Archimedes’ Principle is introduced and demonstrated through a number of problems. The final topic of the lecture is Bernoulli’s Equation.
