 - Ampere's Law
Ampere’s Law is used to find the magnetic field generated by currents in highly symmetric geometries like the infinitely long wire and the solenoid. It is shown how magnetism can be used to convert macroscopic mechanical energy to do microscopic electrical work. Lenz’s and Faraday’s Laws are introduced. The latter says that a changing magnetic field generates a non-conservative electric field.
