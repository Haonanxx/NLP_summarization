 - Success Stories, Innovation and Change from the Grass Roots
Professor Brownell concludes the course by exploring the question of how to change the food environment. He identifies health, environment and social justice as three broad reasons for changing the food environment and highlights the need to unite these initiatives. To address the questions of who creates change and how it happens, Professor Brownell explores top-down change and bottom-up change. As exemplars of both types, he reviews the issue of menu-labeling laws and identifies people who have inspired big change through local action. He then ends by summarizing what his goals have been for the course throughout the semester and highlights the need for innovative change on a variety of levels.
