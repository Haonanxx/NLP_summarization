 - General Review
The last class of the semester consists of a brief recapitulation of topics in the  addressed throughout the course, followed by an extensive question and answer session with the students. The questions posed allow Professor Mazzotta to elaborate on issues raised over the course of the semester, from Dante’s place within the medieval love tradition to the relationship between his roles as poet and theologian.
