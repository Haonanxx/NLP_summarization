 - Inferno XII, XIII, XV, XVI
This lecture focuses on the middle zone of Inferno, the area of violence ( XII-XVI). Introductory remarks are made on the concentration of hybrid creatures in this area of Hell and followed by a close reading of cantos XIII and XV. The pilgrim’s encounter with Pier delle Vigne ( XIII) is placed in literary context ( III). The questioning of authority staged in this scene resurfaces in the circle of sodomy ( XV), where the pilgrim’s encounter with his teacher, Brunetto Latini, is read as a critique of the humanistic values he embodied.
