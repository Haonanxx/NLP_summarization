 - Purgatory XXIV, XXV, XXVI
Guest lecturer Professor David Lummus discusses  XXIV-XXVI. On the terraces of gluttony and lust, the pilgrim’s encounters with masters of the Italian love lyric give rise to the ’s most sustained treatment of poetics. Through Dante’s older contemporary Bonagiunta ( XXIV), the pilgrim distinguishes the poetic style of his youth from that of the courtly love tradition pursued by his interlocutor. In  XXVI, Dante reinforces his own poetic genealogy through his encounter with Guido Guinizelli, founder of the Sweet New Style of poetry he crafted in his youth. The interpretative key to the language of paternity and filiation that pervades these cantos is found in  XXV, where Statius’ embryological exposition of the divine creation of the soul conveys the divinity of poetic inspiration.
