 - Circulation of the Atmosphere (Exam I review)
There is a latitudinal gradient of heat on the Earth caused by the tilt of the Earth’s axis with respect to the sun. This tilt produces seasonal fluctuations in heat input from the sun, as well as an excess of heat received on average annually near the equator. Heat is transferred poleward by both the ocean and atmosphere in an attempt to balance the Earth’s energy budget. The circulation of the Earth also causes a separation of the atmospheric circulation into three main circulation cells, each transporting heat towards the poles.
